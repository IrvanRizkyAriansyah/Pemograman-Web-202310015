    <h6>PENDENGAR BULANAN</h6>
    <P> <span><b>Kunto Aji</b></span> is one of Indonesia’s male singer/songwriter. He released his album called <i>“Generation Y”</i> in 2015.  
        In September 2018, Kunto Aji released his sophomore album called <i>“Mantra, Mantra”</i>. Kunto Aji’s second album captures  
        many people’s attention not only his fans. One of the things that may give an effect of this positive critic is because his  
        songwriting had grown tremendously. In <i>“Mantra, Mantra”</i> he worked with 4 different producers; Ankadiov, Uga Swastadi,  
        Petra Sihombing and Bam Mastro.  
        <span><b>Kunto Aji’s</b></span> second album talks and spread the awareness of how important mental health is. His lead singles “Konon Katanya”  
        reminds people to chase their own dreams despite what other people might say, “Topik Semalam” is a message about a guy who  
        hasn’t proposed to his longtime girlfriend but asking her to be patient because he has his plan to do so, and also “Rehat”  
        a self-reminder to people that it’s completely okay to take a breather for a while. The album went on to receive 5 nominations  
        <u>Anugerah Musik Indonesia (AMI) Awards in 2019 including Best Pop Male Solo Act and Best Album</u>.

    <h1>DANILLA</h1>
    <h3>401,478</h3>
    <h6>PENDENGAR BULANAN</h6>
    <P> With a voice like velvet, a back catalogue of instant classics and a penchant for unpredictability,  <span> <b> Danilla Riyadi </b></span> is one of the most compelling Indonesian music artists in recent years. 
        Born and raised in Jakarta,  <span> <b> Danilla </b></span>'s first emerged as a demure chanteuse with <b>Telisik</b> , her critically-acclaimed, bossa nova-inflected 2014 debut album. Thanks to songs such as 
        <b>Ada Disana</b> and <b>Senja Diambang Pilu</b> ,  <span> <b> Danilla </b></span> would soon become an in-demand live act. For the 2017 sophomore album <b>Lintasan Waktu</b>,  <span> <b> Danilla </b></span> confounded expectations 
        by going into darker territory on a collection of songs – including <b>Aaa</b> and <b>Kalapuna</b> – that  saw her come into her own as a writer. The album coincided with  <span> <b> Danilla </b></span>’s 
        increased popularity on social media thanks to her warts-and-all online persona. She would also branch out into collaborations and acting roles, while continuing to develop musically on <b>Fingers</b>, 
        the 2019 EP that she wrote, performed and produced on her own. In 2022,  <span> <b> Danilla </b></span> released <b>POP SEBLAY</b>, her long-awaited third album that once again saw her embrace new musical directions as 
        heard on tracks like <b>MPV</b> and <b>KIW"</b>. Inspired by and recorded with her backing band and close associates, <b>POP SEBLAY</b> is chock-full of musical and lyrical in-jokes while also comprising  <span> <b> Danilla </b></span>’s strongest collection of songs to date.
